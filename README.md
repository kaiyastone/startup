**this is my __very__ first git commit!!**


**my first notes**
I ran into many problems as I was trying to use github for the first time. It was tricky to figure some of the technicalities out, but I think things will get smoother as I become more familiar with the technology. I am happy I was able to figure out the issues I was running into!!


**Elevator Pitch: **
Haven't we all had the experience of savoring a fresh, buttery, sweet Crumbl cookie, only for it to soon be gone, leaving us wishing for more? But then you remember the substantial price and the hastle to get one, so you rethink your craving. With my Copycat Cookbook, finding and sharing the cookie recipes we crave has never been so easy! You have access to that same crumbl recipe at your finger tips, just waiting for you to make and enjoy. With an option to share your own recipes as well, the community of cookies lovers is sure to be all over this new Copycat Cookbook!

**key features: **
*ability to create account, 
view cookie recipes others have uploaded, 
like or comment on a recipe, 
upload your own cookie recipe*

**HTML what I learned**
I learned about the different tags needed in html files and how they work together to create the formatting. For the more obscure ones, google it! General structure is header, main, footer!
